            Machine Learning In A Rails App
          </a>
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body"><p>At <a href="http://shippingeasy.com/">ShippingEasy</a>, we take customer’s orders from various online storefronts and allow
the customer to easily generate shipping labels to fulfill those orders at a reduced
cost.  To make life even easier on our customers, we wanted to automate the process
of decision making when purchasing a label.  After all, we had a large example set
of data for them – the orders we’ve received and the various shipping choices
that were made from them.  Given that data, couldn’t we use machine learning to
infer what actions a customer would taken when confronted with an order in our
UI?</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/b49OJZlMEgo?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

<p>The answer was yes.  We developed a system dubbed AutoShip that allows us to predict
customer’s shipping choices with great accuracy.  Getting there was not so easy,
however.  Our application is written in Ruby on Rails.  While our team is
full of great software engineers and web development gurus, none of us were
data scientists by trade.  Here are 3 lessons learned learned or relearned on the
journey to bringing machine learning to our product.</p>

<h3 id="build-on-the-shoulders-of-giants">1. Build on the Shoulders of Giants</h3>
<p>Ever hear that truism?  Well, it was hammered home on this project.  I love <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> as
a language and feel <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> is a pretty good framework for building web applications.
But its not exactly a paragon for scientific or statistical computing.  Looking
for a machine learning lib in Ruby?  Good luck.  There are languages where machine
learning libraries are much more mature and active.  R, Python, Scala are examples
of languages with machine learning libraries that far outclass anything Ruby has to
offer.  So we spiked a proof of concept using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">SciKit Learn</a> which got us off the
ground and moving towards a final solution.</p>

<p>The moral here is you really should use the best tool for the job.  We could have
tried to fake-it-till-we-made-it as data scientists, or we could use the tools
written by those who <em>are</em>.</p>

<h3 id="play-to-your-strengths">2. Play To Your Strengths</h3>
<p>We had spiked a workable solution, now we needed to bring it to the product.  Should
we port to Ruby?  Should I stick with Python, the one that had brought us this far?
We decided on the latter, implementing it as a small microservice web application
using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.</p>

<p>Services, even if you attach a micro prefix to them, bring a complexity to all
environments – development, test/ci, production.  To help simplify this, I packaged
the microservice application in a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC">container</a>.  Thus it could be run in
development without RoR developers having to set up a Python environment.  In
production, we deploy the containerized application behind an <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">Haproxy</a> load balancer,
with <a href="https://www.serfdom.io/">Serf</a> managing the cluster of microservice containers to automagically add
themselves to the load balancer.  This enables us to have a scalable infrastructure
that can grow easily as our needs increase.  I plan to elaborate on this further
in a future post.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that implementing the feature as a microservice written
in Python was much easier, at least for me, than trying to rewrite the excellent
machine learning algorithms found in SciKit Learn in Ruby.  I am a systems engineer
with devops skills, and coming up with a robust and scalable microservice
infrastructure was more easily accomplished than suddenly reinventing myself as a
data science uber geek.</p>

<h3 id="polyglot-persistence--yes-its-a-thing">3. Polyglot Persistence.  Yes, its a thing.</h3>
<p>We use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> as our main database.  All of our order and shipment data lived
there.  At first glance, it would seem like we should just use the data as found
in the relational database to back the system.  But for a number of reasons,
We decided to use <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> as the repository for the data that our system
would use.</p>

<p>First, it stores unstructured documents.  We weren’t exactly sure what data we
would need, or how it might evolve over time.  We could shove literally anything
into it and get it back out again without having to migrate a schema.  This
was a very nice boon to have when being exploratory with the data to try and
determine exactly what might yield the results we were after.</p>

<p>Second, its fast and scalable.  If we denormalized an order, shipment and prediction
data into the same document, we would not have to do any complex joins while trying to
get large sets of order/shipment/prediction data used to train a machine learning
algorithm.  And being elastically scalable would mean Elasicsearch could grow
as much as we needed it to.</p>

<p>Lastly, it has <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a>, an amazing data visualiztaion tool.  I had already set up
an Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana stack as outlined in a <a href="http://devquixote.com/devops/2014/10/20/scaling-logstash/">previous post</a>.  Pointing
it at our order, shipment and prediction data has allowed us to have a tremendous
ability to delve into our data.  Without writing any code, we could easily visualize
the answers to questions like “For customer A, what were the packaging choices that
were made for the innacurate predictions made by our service?”  It was invaluable
during the exploratory phase, and is perhaps even more so as the feature is moving
into support-mode post-rollout.</p>

<h3 id="at-the-end-of-the-day">At the end of the day…</h3>
<p>While we had some stumbles along the way, we were able to achieve our goals of
providing &gt; 95% accuracy on predicting shipments for a customers orders.  In doing
so, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/shippingeasy-introduces-industrys-first-smart-130000411.html">we are providing a great service for our customers that makes their jobs
much easier</a>.  As for myself, I got to learn quite a bit about machine learning
and using Linux containers in a production environment.  It was challenging, but
a tremendous amount of fun.  Thanks, for the opportunity, ShippingEasy!</p>

            Scaling Logstash

      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body"><p>I’ve had to wear my dev ops hat for a bit at <a href="http://shippingeasy.com/">ShippingEasy</a>
recently in setting up an ELK stack to provide log aggregation and operational analytics.
That is <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>, <a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a>
&amp; <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/">Kibana</a>.  We’ve become pretty dependent
on the infrastructure, as it enables us to keep an eye on how things are running and
delve into problems in production when support escalations dictate devs get involved.
Here is a view of our production web dashboard showing metrics like average response
time, unicorn workers &amp; queue sizes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/logstash_web.png" alt="Web Dashboard" /></p>

<p>When this was originally set up, it was done with
<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash-forwarder">Logstash-Forwarder</a> on each app server
forwarding log events to Logstash which munged them and indexed them into Elasticsearch.
We could then visualize those log events with Kibana.  This is a typical (possibly naive)
setup that looks something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">logstash-forwarder
                   <span class="se">\</span>
logstash-forwarder  &gt; logstash &gt; elasticsearch &lt; kibana
                   /
logstash-forwarder</code></pre></div>

<p>To get views into the Rails stack, we parsed the log files using multiline and grok
filters with custom patterns in Elasticsearch.  We got around log events interleaving
with each other by having each unicorn process write to its own numbered log file.
This worked well for awhile, but eventually we started to run into problems as traffic
started to ramp up towards a holiday buying season.  Things would work for awhile, but
then gaps of events would start to show up in Kibana, slowing to a trickle and eventually
stop.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it was not that our application was dying.  Logstash was.  Digging in, it
turned out we had two problems that exacerbated and masked each other:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Logstash could not keep up with the demands of munging all of the log events we
were sending to it.</li>
  <li>Logstash 1.4.1-2 has a <a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/issues/1509">bug in its TCP input</a>
that causes it to have a connection leak when clients connecting to it start to time
out due to the previous issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>We fixed the 2nd problem first, patching our version of Logstash with the latest code
that fixes the connection bloom problem.  With that cleared up, we could look at what
the bottleneck was within Logstash.</p>

<p>Logstash is written in jRuby, and its internals are described as <a href="http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/life-of-an-event">a pipeline</a>.
Things are processed by input, filter(worker) and output threads that do the work 
that is set up in the input/filter/output stanzas of the configuration.  Each of
these areas is fronted by a queue that can hold 20 elements.  The threads pull from
the queue, do their work, pass it on to the next queue or out and repeat.  Out of the
box, Logstash allocates one thread to each input, a single worker thread, and one
thread for each output.  This looks something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">input <span class="nb">source</span> --&gt; input thread   filter thread   output thread --&gt; output destination
                            <span class="se">\ </span>  /           <span class="se">\ </span>  /
                            queue           queue
                            /   <span class="se">\ </span>          /   <span class="se">\</span>
input <span class="nb">source</span> --&gt; input thread   filter thread   output thread --&gt; output destination</code></pre></div>

<p>Problems crop up when any of these areas of Logstash cannot pull from its queue faster
than it is filling up.  Logstash as a system backs up, with varying effects depending
on what your input is.  In our case, it was Logstash-Forwarder connection timeouts and
subsequent connection leaking on attempts to reconnect.  If Logstash was pulling from
a redis list as a queue, it would be queue bloat.</p>

<p>Using a combination of top and java thread dumps, we could see our bottleneck was in
the filter worker thread.  The input threads and output threads had little CPU use
and looked to be blocking on their empty queues at all times.  The filter worker thread
was pegging a CPU core, however.  Easy enough, lets just up the number of worker
threads in our Logstash deployment.</p>

<p>Wrong.  Remember that multiline grok filtering I mentioned earlier?  Turns out that
Logstash’s multiline filter is not thread safe and when you use it, you are limited to
only using 1 worker thread.  Okay, then you simply move the multiline event collection
into the input area of Logstash using a multline codec.  Nope, that won’t work either.
The multline filter allows you to specify a stream_identity attribute that can be
used to keep the events separated by file name.  The multiline input codec offers no
such thing, which would mean all our efforts to keep rails multiline log messages
separate from each other would be out the window.</p>

<p>Now we had to step back and re-evaluate the infrastructure.  Ultimately, we decided
to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do the multi-line event roll up on the app server side.  This would become the
responsibility of whatever was tailing the logs and shipping it to Logstash.  We could
then chuck the multiline filter in Logstash and scale out our filter workers within
a single Logstash process.</li>
  <li>Use a redis list as a broker between the tailing daemon app-server side and Logstash
so that we could have some event durability and have the potential to scale out to
multiple Logstash processes on multiple machines to munge through our log data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Logstash forwarder supports neither mutli-line event roll up or communicating to
redis, so this meant we had to find another tailing daemon that did, or we had to deploy
Logstash itself to each app server.  We really did not want to do the latter, as it
introduced java dependencies and seemed very heavy for what needed to be done.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/josegonzalez/python-beaver">Beaver</a>, a log tailing daemon
written in Python that supports both of the above requirements.  We did a quick 
<a href="https://gist.github.com/lwoodson/1b0b34257e5ee652917c">proof of concept</a> to make
sure it would work, deployed it to one web server to see how it performed over 24
hours and then pushed it out across all our servers.  Things have been working well
for several days with no service interruptions.  Now our infrastructure looks like
this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">beaver
      <span class="se">\</span>
beaver &gt; redis &lt; logstash &gt; elasticsearch &lt; kibana
      /
beaver</code></pre></div>

<p>One Logstash instance is still enough for us after pushing multiline-roll up
responsibilities to the Beaver on app servers and being able to use multiple threads/cores
to do filter processing in Logstash.  But when increasing log traffic/size again
starts to overwhelm Logstash, we are better positioned to scale out to multiple
instances munging the data being pushed to redis:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">beaver           logstash
      <span class="se">\ </span>        /        <span class="se">\</span>
beaver &gt; redis &lt;          &gt; elasticsearch &lt; kibana
      /         <span class="se">\ </span>       /
beaver           logstash</code></pre></div>

<p>It was an interesting 3-4 days spent in Logstash-scale land.  It is an amazing tool
that really helps us deliver a quality experience to users of our application.  As
part of an ELK stack, it is the 80% of <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a> that you
really want at no cost.  But without paid licensing, you have to roll up your sleeves
and get to work in cases like these.  Fortunately, there is a great
community behind it and lots of help to be found on the web and in #logstash at
freenode.</p>

            Benchmarking Pdf Generation In Ruby
          </a>
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body"><p>At <a href="http://shippingeasy.com/">ShippingEasy</a>, we use the ruby
<a href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn">Prawn gem</a> to generate shipping label PDFs
for our customers.  This is where we make our money, and so having this be a
fast and pain-free experience is crucial to our business.  Prawn has generally
delivered finished PDFs well, but its performance has been not what we want.
So I have started looking into how we can speed up this process.  Here are
some early results of benchmarking some options including upgrading Ruby, pure
jRuby and jRuby invoking Java.</p>

<p>One thing I did early on was to just collect some basic benchmarking numbers
for Prawn and its rendering of images into PDFs.  There were 4 test groups:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prawn with Ruby 2.0.0 (at the time our current setup)</li>
  <li>Prawn with Ruby 2.1.2 (an upgrade we were undergoing)</li>
  <li>Prawn with jRuby and JIT compilation (no code changes)</li>
  <li>Prawn with jRuby delegating the PDF work to a Java class using <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/">PDFBox</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The benchmark code used was
<a href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/blob/master/bench/png_type_6.rb">Prawn’s png_type_6.rb</a>
(or a java equivalent) and yielded some interesting results…</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Components</th>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>Speed Increase</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Ruby 2.0.0 + Prawn</td>
      <td>6.65s</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ruby 2.1.2 + Prawn</td>
      <td>5.10s</td>
      <td>130%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>jRuby 1.7.12 (JIT) + Prawn</td>
      <td>4.02s</td>
      <td>165%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>jRuby 1.7.12 + Java/PDFBox</td>
      <td>3.26s</td>
      <td>204%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>My takeaways from this are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Upgrade to ruby 2.1.2.  Performance boosts + no code change = win.</li>
  <li>jRuby’s JIT compilation option is no joke.  Your code interprets
to bytecode once and subsequent invocations run the compiled bytecode more
fast than MRI interprets ruby.</li>
  <li>The interoperability between jRuby/Java is a nice feature.  I came up through
the java ranks, so being able to drop to it (instead of C) when needing to
go to a lower-level for performance is handy.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have only upgraded to ruby 2.1.2 at this point, and I do not know if we’ll
wind up doing anything else here.  Even so, its nice to know
we have additional options if we need to continue to improve performance in this
area.</p>
